    Description: |
      I designed and built the core infrastructure of the company's primary product—an online application for invoice management.
      We employed Kubernetes for deploying the application on the cloud via AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). To facilitate seamless communication among the various microservices, Istio was put into action.
      I implemented and configured GitLab to serve as our CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tool. This encompassed the creation of a dynamic pipeline that automates the deployment process for all our services, enhancing our development workflow.
      As part of our internal tools, I developed a comprehensive SDK for use throughout the organization, serving as a vital component across all our microservices.
      Furthermore, I was responsible for crafting multiple microservices and lightweight APIs using .NET Core 7. Additionally, I played a role in the onboarding process and provided guidance to new developers, contributing to their successful integration into the team.

    Description: |
      In this project, I undertook the responsibilities of task creation and assignment, ensuring tasks were delegated to the team based on their individual skill sets. My contributions extended significantly into the backend development.
      The project was an extensive full-stack application encompassing C#, ASP.NET, and Blazor as the UI framework, with EF Core for SQL database interactions. This comprehensive system functioned as a fully featured management platform, addressing document handling, appointment scheduling, medical equipment/materials management, calendar systems, and statistical reporting.
      A noteworthy contribution I made was the development of a modular component named "AutoForm." This innovative component streamlined the creation of forms and modal dialogs, requiring only the specification of the data type. It seamlessly retrieved and saved data from the SQL database, resulting in substantial time savings.
      Throughout the project, effective collaboration was facilitated through the utilization of GIT, ensuring efficient teamwork. The project is currently in active daily use by a substantial user base of thousands of employees, marked by its exceptional reliability and seamless performance.

    Description: |
      The project was devised to extract data from the memory of a legacy 3rd-party software and establish a scripting API for the purpose of developing logic and interfaces in C#. The project team skillfully employed a range of technologies, including C++ for memory access and hosting a .NET environment, C++/CLI to serve as a "glue" facilitating data marshalling from C++ to C#, and the implementation of AppDomains in C# to create a secure and isolated environment for executing scripts and programs.
      In this project, my contributions included closely monitoring the progress of each subproject and conducting in-depth code analysis. I also played a pivotal role in defining the responsibilities, duties, and roles of each team member, ensuring efficient collaboration. As a result, we successfully delivered a highly optimized API, providing a user-friendly interface to extend the capabilities of the legacy software. This achievement notably saved a substantial amount of development time that would otherwise have been required for a complete rewrite.
