      The project was a an easy to use stock management and sales system made in WPF(C#).
      ASP.NET was used for the backend.

      item and an easy to use Interface.
      GIT was used in this project just as a form of backup as the project was small and only me to do it.

    Description: |
      The project was designed to read information from memory of a legacy 3rd party software, and make a
      scripting API so logics and interfaces could be written in C#.
      The team used many technologies to accomplish this, C++ was used to read the memory and host a
      .NET environment, C++/CLI was used to make the C# library as a "glue" to marshal C++ data to C#, 
      we used AppDomains in C# to make a sandboxed environment which scripts and programs could run isolated and safely.
      My contributions to the project were:
        Observed progress of each project and analyzed the code.
        Defined responsibilities, duties, and roles of each team member.
      
      The outcome was a heavily optimized API, which was pretty easy to use and create more features
      using a legacy software that would have to be rewritten from scratch to accomplish the same thing, we
      saved a lot of developer's time.
